# nbdev testing

I am intending to create a simulation of "conversation".
It is based on ["Emotion Recognition Using Graph Convolutional Networks"](https://towardsdatascience.com/emotion-recognition-using-graph-convolutional-networks-9f22f04b244e) and the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11540) as a test of nbdev environment
